This is a collecion of hacks for quick-and-dirty organizing new contests.

If you follow normal installation procedure, please ignore this directory.

Assuming that you want this, copy all files from this folder to "pc2/bin/"
and also copy "valodator.py" to "pc2/bin". You will need to overwrite "pc2server".

"./completeRebootInject.sh" will stop pc^2 and start it again with many things
already added which does simplify administration, especially if you are a student
and don't have time to waste on setup of contests.
